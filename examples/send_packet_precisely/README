EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

The 'send_packet_precisely' application illustrates the various steps to schedule
packets for sending.

The simple spp application requires root permissions to execute and 
attach to the driver.
	sudo ./send_packet_precisely

To exit the app, hit Ctrl-C. The application gracefully tears down
the connection to the driver. If the application unexpectedly aborts the
kernel-mode driver also reclaims the various buffers and attempts to clean up.
The application should be able to re-initialize and use the transmit queues
without restarting the driver.

/* Note this application requires using the provided gptp timesync daemon to
provide the 802.1AS presentation times included in the 1722 frames. */

Lastly, to build the application, you need to have the pciutils library
installed. the latest version can be downloaded from:

	< ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/utils/pciutils/ >.

Download and extract the library, and run 'make;make install;make install-lib'.
